impact: 'The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information
  or perform unauthorized actions.

  '
remediation: Ensure this permission is restricted to specific groups that require
  it via Administration > System > Global Permissions. Turning the feature off will
  not affect existing filters and dashboards. If you change this setting, you will
  still need to update the existing filters and dashboards if they have already been
  shared publicly. Since Jira 7.2.10, a dark feature to disable site-wide anonymous
  access was introduced.
