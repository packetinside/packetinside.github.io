## 🔍 Vulnerability Description
WordPress Essential Real Estate plugin before 3.9.6 contains an authenticated cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, which can allow someone with a role as low as admin to inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and launch of other attacks.
