remediation: 'The issue has been mitigated and closed in Supervisor version 2023.03.1,
  which has been rolled out to all affected installations via the auto-update feature
  of the Supervisor. This rollout has been completed at the time of publication of
  this advisory. Home Assistant Core 2023.3.0 included mitigation for this vulnerability.
  Upgrading to at least that version is thus advised. In case one is not able to upgrade
  the Home Assistant Supervisor or the Home Assistant Core application at this time,
  it is advised to not expose your Home Assistant instance to the internet.
