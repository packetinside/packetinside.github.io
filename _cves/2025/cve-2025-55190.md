## 🔍 Vulnerability Description
Argo CD API tokens with project-level permissions are able to retrieve sensitive repository credentials
(usernames, passwords) through the project details API endpoint, even when the token only has standard
application management permissions and no explicit access to secrets. This vulnerability affects versions
v2.2.0-rc1 and later, including 2.13.0 through 2.13.8, 2.14.0 through 2.14.15, 3.0.0 through 3.0.12,
and 3.1.0-rc1 through 3.1.1. Any token with project get permissions is vulnerable, including global permissions.
Note: This template requires valid ArgoCD credentials (username/password) to test the vulnerability.
